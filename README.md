# My Big Improvement!
This project represents my improvement as a developer.

In initial commit code quality and app's fuctionality is low, but I have created this repository to change this and have some (I hope good) developer story. 

# Purpose of this app
This is just a chat app. The only reaaaly interesting feature is that one create chats in this app at some location and can configure a zone of "accessibility" of the chat.
For example, if you have created a chat in Los Angeles and have setted a zone to, say, 10 km, one can access it only if he's in this zone. (Sorry for long explanation, I'll work on it too!)

# Manifesto
I will mark the items of this manifesto as proceed and finish them. Also, this list isn't immutable, I will often add items to it (and will try not to delete these!).

1. Implement fetching chats within some radius and displaying these to user.

2. Implement creating of a chat.
2.1. Add a message uploading for chat that's being created.

3. Implement messaging in chat rooms.
3.1. Implement navigation to some user's profile when click on his image in a chat.
3.2. Implement selection of a message.
3.3. Implement a couple of data types that can be sent with a message. For instance, user can send message with a text and with some photo\video\many photos\gif\url\other message or whatever you can imagine.
3.4. Implement "reply" feature.

4. Implement some basic user profile.
